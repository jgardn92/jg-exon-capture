Make list of Samples
	- Species
	- Identifying number
	- Tissue remaining
	- DNA Extract Remaining
	- Note who extracted
	- Note which samples went through PCR more
	- Only look at Everything that made it through the DNA step
	
COI blast against preassembly sequences. Use melanurus COI as test to start and see if anything pops out. 
Contamination 
	- R or Bash 
	- second table with list of loci and counts of number of identical sequences
	- write script that looks at each gene aligned file and flags taxa that are identical - p distance of 0
	- from there return those that are identical but are different species.
	- table with taxa by taxa comparison with counts of all genes where they are identical. 
		- also lists of genes where the identical taxa exist
