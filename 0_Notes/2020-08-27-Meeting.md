# 2020-08-27 Meeting with Calder
***
## RAxML Plan
1. Try rerunning RAxML locally with the *Oreochromis* manually removed from concatenated file and see if errors are the same.
	* if errors same, try writing a loop to delete gaps
	* also try running Calder's R script for removing *Oreochromis* from each gene
2. Try removing *Oreochromis* before alignment, then align and don't filter before running tree.

## Renaming Plan
1. Try `taxnameconvert.pl` to rename in concatenated file
2. If can't get that to work, try Calder's `sed` script to rename.

## Not Removing Variable Sites
1. Script from [Eleni](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s595/client/snv?noteGuid=68aa8847-e4d9-4150-b0f7-b4112f420c73&noteKey=fb85db09a7ebbca8&sn=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evernote.com%2Fshard%2Fs595%2Fsh%2F68aa8847-e4d9-4150-b0f7-b4112f420c73%2Ffb85db09a7ebbca8&title=017%253A%2BMYBAITS%2Bvariant%2Bcalling)
2. Look into `gatk`
