INFORMATION:
------------
Taxnameconvert is a tool to convert taxon names within PHYLIP 
format tree files.


INSTALLATION:
-------------
To use taxnameconvert, just copy the file taxnameconvert.pl to 
any directory in your executable search path. If you cannot
execute taxnameconvert.pl, it might be necessary to change the 
script's first line from

#! /usr/bin/env perl

to

#! /path/to/perl

Where the path to the perl executable has to be adopted appropriately
(often /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin on UNIX systems).
Usually /usr/bin/env tries to find the right path on UNIX systems.

Of course, you have to have PERL installed (http://www.cpan.org).


MORE INFOS:
-----------
Call 'taxnameconvert.pl -h' for more instructions!!
