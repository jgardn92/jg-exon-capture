# 2020-09-08 Meeting notes
## To Do
* Ping calder about consensus tree with branch lengths preserved
* Ping about contamination guideline
* Email Jay et al for alignments

## Contamination

* Plot histogram of % contamination
	* use 15% contam as cutoff -> flag those
	* Sort by sample and go sample by sample to decide which ones look problematic
	* Potentially redo detect_contam with moving more closely related things togehter (L tun l marm)
* Remove contaminated samples and rerun tree.

## Filter 2 script

* Have the prealigned (post pick_taxa) in one folder.
* Have filter2 script look at aligned data, find problem sequence in file on alignment and remove that sequence from same named gene file in prealigned.

* Look for scripts that do p-distance
* Given an alignment give me the average p-distance
* Can write routines in Geneious
