# Contaminated Taxa Selection

###2020-09-15 Notes
* Drop one crystallichthys -> whichever is more contaminated based on detect_contam.pl
* Drop the *Paraliparis mento* at the base of the tree
** Select contaminated taxa by:**
* Look for species with two reps in two diff spots
	* Remove one in wrong spot.
* Start with ones very obviously wrong
* Only remove a few at a time (4-5)
* For each screening, write down taxa that get pulled out
